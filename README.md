Tic-Tac-Toe React
A simple and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React. Players can take turns to play the game, and the board will display the winner or prompt the next player to play.

Features
Two-player gameplay: Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) take turns.

Game state tracking: Keeps track of the game history and allows players to jump to previous moves.

Responsive design: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.

Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

CSS: For styling the game components.

Vite: A modern build tool that provides fast development environment setup for React projects.

How It Works
The game board consists of 9 squares.

The first player to align three symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

The game history is stored, allowing you to view past moves or jump back to a specific move.
